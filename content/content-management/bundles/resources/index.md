## Properties

ResourceType
: The main type of the resource. For exemple a file of MIME type `image/jpg` has for ResourceType `image`.

Name
: The filename (relative path to the bundle). It can be overwritten with the resource's Front Matter metadata.

Title
: Same as filename. It can be overwritten with the resource's Front Matter metadata.

Permalink
: The absolute URL of the resource.

RelPermalink
: The relative URL of the resource.

## Methods
ByType
: Retrieve the page resources of the passed type.

```go
{{ .Resources.ByType "images" }}
```
Match
: Retrieve all the page resources whose Name matches the [Glob pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glob_(programming)) passed as parameter. The matching is case insensitive.

```go
{{ .Resources.Match "images/*" }}
```

GetMatch
: Same as Match but will only retrieve the first matching resource.

```go
//Using Match/GetMatch to find this images/sunset.jpg ?
.Resources.Match "images/sun*" ✅ 
.Resources.Match "**/Sunset.jpg" ✅
.Resources.Match "images/*.jpg" ✅
.Resources.Match "**.jpg" ✅ 
.Resources.Match "*" 🚫
.Resources.Match "sunset.jpg" 🚫
.Resources.Match "*sunset.jpg" 🚫

```

## Metadata

Resources metadata management is possible from the Front Matter's array `resources`. Batch assign is made possible using glob pattern matching.

~~~yaml
title: "Sunflare 101"
date: 2018-01-09T13:03:53-05:00
resources:
 - src: "*/sunset.jpg"
   title: "Beautiful Sunset"
 - src: "*/sunrise.jpg"
   title: "Beautiful Sunrise"
   name: "sunrise-1"
 - src: "*/*.jpg"
   params: 
     credits: Hugo Doe
     license:CC BY
 - src: "*/japan-sunset.jpg"
   params: 
     credits: 森山大道
~~~ 

In the example above:

- `sunset.jpg` will receive a distinct `Title`
- `sunrise.jpg` will receive a distinct `Title` and `Name` and won't be retrieved by `.Match "*/sunrise.jpg"` anymore but something like `.Match "sunrise-*"`.
- Every jpg in the bundle will receive the same `credits` and `license` parameter.
- `japan-sunset.jpg` will receive a distinct `credits`

The __order matters__, each rule overwriting the params assigned by the previous one on their shared target. The specific rule for `*/japan-sunset.jpg` has to be declared after the more generic `*/*.jpg`.

## Available metadata
